# About Nameless

Throughout the I Ching, we encounter nameless pawns: arrogant dragon, the forester, the young fool, the superior man, the maiden, the great prince, a petty man, the Son of Heaven, the Supreme Deity. Owing its admittedly masculine lean in modern interpretation to the many centuries of androcracy this timeless work of balance and harmony has endured as the pendulum has reached its Martian zenith today (we stand now at the moment of stillness before the pendulum swings back), the men, the maidens, the dragons, are not the protagonists of this story. The I Ching tells a story of the changes we experience, of the moments of choice in which we manifest what is to be, of the cusps and corners and junctures of the 10-D multiverse.

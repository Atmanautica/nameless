# Designing Nameless

A grid of tiles with cards that hover over.

Each tile contains a change from among the 64.

A change comprises an array of names and numbers and interpretations, the longer aspects of which are portrayed on the card, while the shorter bits are framed about the tile.

The guest is invited to produce the burning question of the moment, then asked and instructed how to divine the change that applies to it using three coins.

Entering the result of the divination, the guest sees the tile of that change highlit and the card displayed in detail.

One side of the card displays the written interpretations of the change, while the other side explores the two trigrams of which its six lines are composed, and the image they form together.

If any of the lines in the guest's cast are changing, the guest sees that line of the hexagram highlit, and tapping it, sees the written interpretation of that changing line.

The guest may also explore the changes without presenting a question, tapping tiles to see their cards, and flipping the cards as desired.

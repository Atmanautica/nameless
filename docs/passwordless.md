# Going Passwordless

## How to Magic.link passwordless login to your Vue 3 app and allow users to sign up and login by email

## Also how to use phone number to sign **up**

I am very pleased to see Cotter and Magic Link gaining traction. But their business models have repelled me. Clearly they have accepted VC money and are now in a hurry to convert those they might serve into revenue sources. We'll be going around them, tapping the vibrant open source community around passwordless authentication, and sharing our journey that you dear devsigner might walk this path without a machete.
